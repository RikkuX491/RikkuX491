Welcome to my GitHub page! My name's Ricardo! 😁

I am an experienced Software Engineer who specializes in full-stack development.

I'm always looking for new projects and opportunities to get involved with creatively ambitious institutions, companies, and people – if you're looking for an equally ambitious and creative technologist, let's connect! 🗣
